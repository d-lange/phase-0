  Git is a very useful tool to track the changes you make. By utilizing version
  control, git makes it easy to see the history of a file through the various
  snapshots that are taken each time a file is edited. You can do this by
  through commits. Commits are an action or collection of actions that are taken
  to modify a file. Then those actions are committed, the current version as
  well as the previous versions are available to view. It allows you to see
  what you've changed throughout the history of the file.</p>

    <p>While you're in the terminal and making changes, git status is a useful
  command to show you what, if any, files have been modified or are untracked.
  It also tells you what you need to do to move those files to a commit or what
  the next stage is for those files.

      <h2>David's display blog</h2>
      <p>
      When writing CSS code, we use the property 'display' which helps determine how an element is displayed on the page. From here, we specify whether we want whatever we're styling to be inline, block, or inline-block and with proper syntax looking like this: [display: inline;] or [display: inline-block;].
    </p>
    <p>
      Visually, when displaying an inline element, it won't look like much, but having multiple elements together, you'll see they are viewed next to one another. This is because an inline element does not affect anything but what's between the tag itself.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We used the section tag. This was because we had one post from each of us. We wanted to create a section for our posts but then sub-sections for each of ours. When looking through chrome devtools, everything looked very concise, flowed properly. Nothing complicated. I felt the easier it flows, the more control CSS has in styling the HTML.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Everything in the body tag will be visible to on the browser page. Typically, you'd use <h1>..<h6> to define headings and as well as use <section>, <article>, and <p> to really lay out the content. If you use the header tag it will be at the top, as well as footer will be at the bottom. These are new HTML5 elements that make it easier to lay out content. It allows us to use less divs to describe what the content is on the page.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
</html>

THe sublime snippet was really interesting. I had no idea sublime had the power to do that and now I have a full html skeleton that will always generate for me. I can definitely see myself creating more snippets in the future to enable me to create pages faster and more intuitively. I haven't utilized the shortcuts as much as I should. I think that's my next step. Now that I'm familiar with everything up-to-date, it's about speed and getting faster with these processes.
