<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was awesome! It's clear I have a lot to learn, but it's also amazing at how much I've learned in just two weeks in this program verse learning on my own. I'm starting to use the inspect tool on chrome to look at html of other very popular sites, it's really cool to see how they have been built.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I enjoyed researching it because I think it definitely makes things easier as a programmer. But, for this particular assignment. I didn't think I needed to really use any of the new tags. I was able to get the site to look structurally the same using regular HTML.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I believe I did well with best practices. I know this is just the content laid out in a structure. Although I did have to make sure the image and text were on the same line.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML seems good because it's an easy way lay out content and plan a design by structure and heirarchy of tags. It also seems kind of bad because of the way you have to follow the rules.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I don't really have tricks, but I know it the main structure of an html file is <!DOCTYPE html> then the <html> <head> and <title> and <body> tags and of course to make sure they're closed.
