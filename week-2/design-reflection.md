###What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to showcase myself in the digital sense as a creative entity. The kind of content my site will feature will be a culmination of my abilities as a software developer with a portfolio, a collection of my music compositions, information about myself, how to contact me, as well as a blog for thought-leadership and personable reflections that can be relatable to others.

###What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

I think my target audience's interests will be to either find a skilled web developer or a skilled composer. As these are two creative endeavors, I'd assume creative people might be interested in my site. People learning to code will be interested in visiting my site because the blog will address my experience as a programmer and perhaps music projects.

My site will address these interests by having three main sections consisting of web development projects, music projects, and the blog. I imagine a home page explaining who I am and what I do, from there the user can pick from other options such as web dev projects, my music, blog, and contact.

###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I think my site will have several actions for different kinds of visitors. Some might be looking at my web dev projects and my abilities, while others might be interested in my music, or might want to read about my progress as a programmer and a composer and learn from some tips. All things that might prompt them to want to contact me. My site is to share myself with the digital community and make new relationships with the way I've presented myself.

###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

I think some main things someone should know about design and user experience is that it can be subjective. A client might want a certain design while the user is really expressing something different. User experience is based on emotions, not how easy it is to use, but these can also be related.

It's very important to have an open communication throughout the design process, constantly showing samples or prototypes.

Lastly, design and user experience nowadays are completely focused on the end-user. You are relying on them going to your site so the design needs to always appeal to your visitors.

###What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is how a person feels when interfacing with a system. It is valuable because the better a person feels about a system, the more they'll visit, the more they'll talk about it with friends, and more people will start visiting your website. A UX designer helps with user experience by evaluating ease of use, perception of value, utilitiy, efficiencies in performing tasks, etc.
###Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

The reading about design and user experience actually felt tedious, but the directions for the markdown of the image into this file and using relative path sort of confused me. I used slack to communicate with other people in the cohort to discuss it and I actually helped a few people who didn't notice what I did. I'm embracing the confusion!
