# 1.1 Think About Time
During this assignment I learned about many different ways to manage my time, behavior, confidence, and evaluation of productivity. Specifically, meditation and the differences between focused attention and mindful meditation. I also learned about mindset and how confidence can actually come from tiny successful actions, proving to oneself they are capable, which creates the confidence down the road. I also learned about the Fogg Method and the Pomodoro technique, which is a "Time Box." "Time Boxing" is a technique in which one sets a certain time to achieve a goal and once the time is up, take a break. Within this allotted time, make sure to recap and reflect on what you're learning. It's also important to understand how many blocks of time will it take to achieve your goal, rather than just working until completion. I found this to be extremely useful in prepping for Dev Bootcamp. Going forward in Phase 0, I will use this to make sure my mindset is focused and clear on the objective at hand. With every tiny task I complete, the more confidence I will have.

I currently manage my time carefully because I don't necessarily have all the free time in the world. I still have a full-time job. Typically, I will get home from work, go to the gym or play music for 45 minutes (this is therapeutic but also resets my mind for programming after a full day of work. I then will spend 30 minute intervals working on code and taking breaks until I have achieved what I need to. My current strategy has been working, but it took a while to form this habitual routine. In the beginning I definitely felt this "avoidance." I wanted to do it, but the feeling of failure and lack of knowledge was scary. Initial motivation has gotten me to a place where I can now reflect and analyze how to improve further on my time management.

My plan for phase 0 is to focus on meditation more. I think my stress and anxiety come from the nonstop rumination of thoughts, whether they are good or bad, that clutter my mind when it comes to focusing on complex tasks. Teaching myself guitar and piano, I feel like I do have an understanding of learning, creating habits which change behavior, and confidence. Now I'm excited to apply this all to becoming a successful programmer.

## 1.2 The Command Line
After reviewing this material, it seems that a shell in computing is what interprets input from a user allowing them to communicate with the operating system or the inner workings of the computer. In this instance, I am using the Bash shell as the user interface to communicate with the computer. Bash is just a type of shell.

The most challenging part of this material is the memorization of the commands, as well as completely seeing what I was doing in the CLI vs the graphic interface. I was able to use most of the commands and see how they worked. I got tripped up on the copypaste and move commands and it actually working.

I think the most important commands to know are pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm. These seem like the main commands you'd need to really navigate through the computer and know where you are within a path or directory.

Off the top of my head I'll try and describe what the commands do:

pwd - shows you what directory you're currently in

ls - lists what's inside the directory

mv - moving a file or directory

cd - changes directory

../ - goes back to the previous directory

touch - creates an empty file if it doesn't exist

mkdir - makes a new directory

less - used to view a txt file one screen at a time

rmdir - remove a directory

rm - remove a file

help - explains a built-in command
