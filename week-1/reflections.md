# 1.1 Think About Time
During this assignment I learned about many different ways to manage my time, behavior, confidence, and evaluation of productivity. Specifically, meditation and the differences between focused attention and mindful meditation. I also learned about mindset and how confidence can actually come from tiny successful actions, proving to oneself they are capable, which creates the confidence down the road. I also learned about the Fogg Method and the Pomodoro technique, which is a "Time Box." "Time Boxing" is a technique in which one sets a certain time to achieve a goal and once the time is up, take a break. Within this allotted time, make sure to recap and reflect on what you're learning. It's also important to understand how many blocks of time will it take to achieve your goal, rather than just working until completion. I found this to be extremely useful in prepping for Dev Bootcamp. Going forward in Phase 0, I will use this to make sure my mindset is focused and clear on the objective at hand. With every tiny task I complete, the more confidence I will have.

I currently manage my time carefully because I don't necessarily have all the free time in the world. I still have a full-time job. Typically, I will get home from work, go to the gym or play music for 45 minutes (this is therapeutic but also resets my mind for programming after a full day of work. I then will spend 30 minute intervals working on code and taking breaks until I have achieved what I need to. My current strategy has been working, but it took a while to form this habitual routine. In the beginning I definitely felt this "avoidance." I wanted to do it, but the feeling of failure and lack of knowledge was scary. Initial motivation has gotten me to a place where I can now reflect and analyze how to improve further on my time management.

My plan for phase 0 is to focus on meditation more. I think my stress and anxiety come from the nonstop rumination of thoughts, whether they are good or bad, that clutter my mind when it comes to focusing on complex tasks. Teaching myself guitar and piano, I feel like I do have an understanding of learning, creating habits which change behavior, and confidence. Now I'm excited to apply this all to becoming a successful programmer.

## 1.2 The Command Line
After reviewing this material, it seems that a shell in computing is what interprets input from a user allowing them to communicate with the operating system or the inner workings of the computer. In this instance, I am using the Bash shell as the user interface to communicate with the computer. Bash is just a type of shell.

The most challenging part of this material is the memorization of the commands, as well as completely seeing what I was doing in the CLI vs the graphic interface. I was able to use most of the commands and see how they worked. I got tripped up on the copypaste and move commands and it actually working.

I think the most important commands to know are pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm. These seem like the main commands you'd need to really navigate through the computer and know where you are within a path or directory.

Off the top of my head I'll try and describe what the commands do:

pwd - shows you what directory you're currently in

ls - lists what's inside the directory

mv - moving a file or directory

cd - changes directory

../ - goes back to the previous directory

touch - creates an empty file if it doesn't exist

mkdir - makes a new directory

less - used to view a txt file one screen at a time

rmdir - remove a directory

rm - remove a file

help - explains a built-in command

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning
Here are my instructions on how to CREATE a new repo, FORK a repo, and CLONE a repo:

1) Once logged into your GitHub account, go to the top right of the main page and to the left of your profile picture, you'll see a plus sign. Hover the mouse over it and you'll even see it says "Create new." Click the "+" sign and you'll be able to CREATE new a repository within your GitHub account. *Note this is not automatically synced with your local machine.

2) To FORK a repo, you must be on someone else's GitHub profile. The point of "forking" is to get a copy of there repository. This allows you to use the code and play with it while not changing the original repository you forked (copied) it from. Once you're on someone else's GitHub profile and click a repository you want, the right hand side of the web page you'll see the word "Fork" with a symbol that looks like a "Y." You simply click Fork and then choose the profile you're forking the repository to, which would be your own. GitHub will then bring you to your Forked repository in your profile. *Note this is not automatically synced with your local machine.

3) Lastly, CLONING a repo is how you get your repository in GitHub onto your local machine, essentially syncing with GitHub using a URL. First step, you want to make sure you're cloning the repository in the right place on your computer. Using the command line, navigate your way into a specific folder you want to clone a repository into. You'll use commands such as pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, etc. Once you have your location set, go back to GitHub and look for the HTTPS or SSH URL. Mine says HTTPS is recommended. You copy this to your clipboard and then go back to your command line. You type: git clone (and paste the URL). You might be prompted for your GitHub username and password and press enter. You'll see some code run and then you can check using commands to see that the repository is now CLONED where you saved it. You can open this in Sublime to get a better view all of the files and directories.



You'd fork a repository as opposed to create a new one because a forked repository is code that has already been written. It is something you want to copy and use for your own or look inside and mess with the code. Whereas, creating a new repository contains no written code and is as if you're starting from scratch.

I didn't have much trouble setting up my git and GitHub, once familiar with the commands I felt pretty cool being able to navigate my computer and clone repositories from GitHub. I'm starting to feel like a noob programmer! I learned more about the relationship between git and GitHub and how they are simultaneously used to achieve efficiency.
