###Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

###Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
On the GitHub profile page, look at the top right corner. You'll see a "+" sign and the option to create a new repository. You'll want to name it, make it public, and set an MIT License. Once created, look for an HTTPS link and copy it. Go to your search bar on your computer and find/open the terminal. You will then use the command pwd to see where you are on the machine, then use the command ls to see what's inside where you are. Use cd command to get into a folder. and ls to list what's inside. You'll want to find a place to paste the repository. In the terminal you will then type git clone and paste the URL link you copied. You might have to enter in your GitHub username and password and then you'll see some code run and it will saved onto your local machine.

###Describe what open source means.
Open source means that the original source code is available for free and can be modified and changed as well as redistributed.

###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open source is a good thing. Wordpress is a great example of how open source can improve a product while creating a vast community of users. They don't have to pay for new features to be added because developers have the source code to develop new features.

###Assess the importance of using licenses.
Using licenses is important especially in the open source world. Certain licenses define the difference between being able to redistribute code or give credit to contributors or original authors.

###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The communication between git and GitHub and commands used for this process were solidified in this challenge and really understanding the relationship between the two. I struggled a little bit with making sure my feature branch was merged with the master branch and data pushed to github was also on my local computer. Now it all makes a lot of sense and how to do it correctly.

###Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I only used the resources provided through the challenge. It was mostly rewatching a video, making myself the list of processes and then practicing in the terminal and with GitHub. I actually enjoy being stumped for a few seconds and then realizing the step or command I'm at to get done what needs to be done.
